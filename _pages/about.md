Hi, I'm Alan and currently a student in the Combined Bachelor's/Master's (BS/MS) program at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). 

I have worked on NLP research since early 2022 feel honored to be working with [Prof. Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/), [Jungo Kasai](https://jungokasai.github.io/), and [Mr. Phillip Keung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VdI1yDcAAAAJ&hl=en). 

My past research experiences mainly cover efficiency and generative retrieval. Here is my [CV](https://lihaoxin2020.github.io/files/cv_12.5.pdf). 

I'm currently applying for PhD program starting Fall 2024. Feel free to reach out!
