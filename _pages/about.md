Hi, I'm Alan and currently a PhD student at [Yale NLP](https://yale-nlp.github.io/), working with [Prof. Arman Cohan](https://armancohan.com/).

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degree from Combined BS/MS program at the [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). During my time there, I was fortunate to be a part of the ARK Lab, where I worked with [Prof. Noah A. Smith](https://nasmith.github.io/), [Jungo Kasai](https://jungokasai.github.io/), and [Mr. Phillip Keung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VdI1yDcAAAAJ&hl=en). My past research experiences mainly cover efficiency, multimodality, and generative retrieval. Feel free to reach out! 

I'm also an ex-intern at [Kotoba Tech](https://www.kotoba.tech/), a fast-growing startup focusing on audio AI system in Tokyo, Japan! Check out their exciting demo on [X](https://x.com/kotoba_tech)!
